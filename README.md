<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://yeahimjt.github.io/serenity)

Serenity Peace is a safe place where users can share their stories regarding their mental health to empower themselves and inspire others. It's functionality is quite similar to that of Instagram or Twitter where users who are logged in can be given a custom timeline from creators they follow for a more taillored reading experience. Users sessions are stored via cookies securely and are distributed from client->server through appropriately configured CORS options and utilizing Top-Level Domain/Sub-Level Domain appropriately.

My approach for this project was to create something that I felt could truly be of service in someones life. From this intial idea I went through all of the appropriate steps to creating this application by using a 7 step SDLC that included steps: Requirements & Analysis, Project Planning, Design, Coding & Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. 

Now that the project has been completed here are some things I accomplished:
* A clean UI/UX experience with a clear path for the user to follow to start sharing/reading stories.
* Error logic is handled appropriately where user will get instant feedback when error occurs.
* The Web Application is a single web page application using react-router-dom so load times of images/pages are minimal so the user recieves promptly.
* Stories/Creators are filterable to narrow down on content the user wishes to read
* Users can Peer-To-Peer message those who inspired them from their stories
* Users can easily edit their profile or stories

Although I have marked the project as complete I will continue to update its features and fix any bugs that may occur.
